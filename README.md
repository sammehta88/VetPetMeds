# VetPetMeds: The Vet Tech Tool

The idea behind this project is to create a tool for Vet Techs to easily determine the correct dosage needed for common veterinary procedures. The dosage is calculated based on the weight of the animal and will be displayed in an easy to read and visually appealing manner - with minimal work on the part of the user. When signed in, the user can save animals and log medication dosages.
