# VetPetMeds: The Vet Tech Tool

The idea behind this project is to create a tool for Vet Techs to easily determine the correct dosage needed for common veterinary procedures. The dosage is calculated based on the weight of the animal and will be displayed in an easy to read and visually appealing manner - with minimal work on the part of the user. When signed in, the user can save animals and log medication dosages.

##Installation Instructions
Access the web app here: [VetPetMeds](https://vetpetmeds.herokuapp.com/)

##How to use
Without signing up, you can access the dosage calculator from the home screen. After clicking on the button, enter the animal type, the weight of the animal, and pick the medication from the dropdown menu. 

By signing up and logging in to this website, you have access to other features including:
* Create new animal profiles and access already created animals by clicking on the ANIMALS tab
* Dosages can be calculated through each animal's profile page
* After calculating the correct dosage, save this dose to the animal's medication log
